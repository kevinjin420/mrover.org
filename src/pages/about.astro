          MRover's primary goal is to win the University Rover Challenge (URC).
          Student teams from all over the world compete in the URC to design and build the best rover for assisting
          future astronauts.
          The URC is hosted by The Mars Society, the largest advocacy group for the exploration and settlement of Mars,
          and it takes place at the Mars Research Station in the Utah Desert.
          The competition consists of four events:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Extreme Retrieval and Delivery - Traveling over tough terrain</li>
          <li>Equipment Servicing - Manipulating various pieces of equipment with the robotic arm</li>
          <li>Science - Acquiring soil samples from a chosen site and evaluating it for signs of life</li>
          <li>Autonomous Navigation - Driving to GPS coordinates and searching for markers nearby</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          CIRC is hosted by the Canadian Space Technology Advancement Group and takes place in Drumheller, Alberta. The
          competition consists of five events:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-2">
          <li>Boneyard Salvage - Assess the reactor site's location, damage, radiation and hazards</li>
          <li>Reactor Maintenance - Replace depleted reactor rods while managing temperature and coolant levels</li>
          <li>Arm Dexterity - Manipulating equipment and carrying cargo to service a lander</li>
          <li>Traversal - Autonomously locate stations and follow a trail of lights at night</li>
          <li>Mars Murder Mystery - Photograph a murder scene, scan ArUco tags, and return items</li>
        </ul>

            Our Autonomy team is further divided into 3 subteams: Navigation, Perception, and Localization.
            Navigation plans and executes a path for the rover to search an area while avoiding obstacles.
            Perception identifies key features of the environment (objective markers) and obstacles in the path.
            The rover's navigation system uses A* to path plan around obstacles for the autonomy mission.
            The cost map grid is periodically centered on the rover to support obstacle avoidance over longer
            distances without needing a larger grid. Recent autonomy projects include working on integrating
            inverse kinematics onto our rover's robotic arm.

            systems (such as our robotic arm) to improve accuracy and usability.
